## Java Baics - Crash Course

This code was partially provided from the course "Java Baics - Crash Course", thaught by [Programming with Alex](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithalex.585/) in the [FreeCodeCamp YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp)

You can find the entire course [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdzRzWymT4c).

## Final Thoughts

My goal with this course was to familiarize myself with Java's syntax and language-specific quirks.

Altough the course was quite superficial, I believe I've achieved that goal, which will make it easier for me to get into more complex concepts.
